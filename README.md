# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project predicts the likelihood of developing heart disease using logistic regression based on the **Framingham Heart Study** dataset. The model is trained using features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and smoking habits.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values and normalizes features.
- **Model:** Logistic regression to predict heart disease risk.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess model performance.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hansaka2001/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_Prediction_Using_Logistic_Regression.ipynb
   ```
